# Notes on Mrs Elton, Emma



This notes is about the depiction of Mrs Elton, in Emma, though the method of 'Stream of Consciousness'. For example, in the passage in Vol III, Ch 6.

`Mrs Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of.-`

It emphasises, with the use of 'apparatus', or the naming of such apparatuses in serial form, suggests not the nature of the world but only of her perception, and achieves without ever hinting a kind of companionship between the narrator and the reader, often at the expense of the narrated at.
