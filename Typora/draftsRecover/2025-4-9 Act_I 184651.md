# Act I



Afterwords, It was said that her death lingered, like lullaby of some past lives it stayed on. It was said she might as well have been right, a life like that, was it even worth living, it was said that her father had, after all, knew what she knew, knew about it all and was after all proud. It was said on morning of this January a little girl of some seven jumped into this wide iced like river, made it solid choppy red for few harrowing hours, it was said revenge for this girl had already been done, that the family responsible had already lynched. It was said that the family was not lynched at all, that they had escaped through the last of the late night trains, that though the village chased after with they couldn't keep up. It was said she still sung late in night for anyone considerate, all they had to do was to come, and listen. It was said on a villa that faced that river, on whose banks it was built by hands later cut off, there was a diamond left still after independence, and which had late that night disappeared. 

The diamond had disappeared under this mistress. She was sleeping when it was gone, she was celebrating beforehand. The diamond had disappeared when it were jubilation, when men fought then laughed it off and girls were flirting with each other, when boys drank late till late in night and women forgot to look after them. It had disappeared when the family of Kumbh decided upon a little celebration to bid off Holi, a night to let everything spill so tomorrow morning could bring new beginnings. It was stolen because, after the death of the Patriarch, his mistress inherited everything, began to spread rumours about it. The diamond that had belonged for so long in the line of that family, that had not seen any hands not of there kin, had been desecrated in front of that crowd, of the villagers and there rumours. That which had not seen light for centuries, was paraded in open view. The diamond was stolen because precisely that was the justice, and precisely this--her rumoured suicide, her blood just behind this curtained screen--was the retribution. In the rain of the next morning, when everything in colour was washed away, the town was gathering to gawk and coo like crows in between the roads that lead in and out all crowded with men and women, the gates that was suppose to guard the mansion left open, the guards-- afraid for there life--already fleeing. So, what could have been a better sight for her that this, when she was visiting after so long her only family. 

The bus lurched forward best that it could across the unpaved road, through the lush overgrown gardens--there hands of there trees like lecherous old men groping across her windows--into what the rusted metal plank, too large for it's good and with intricate colouring, all faded, left at the turn of that road, before which was the city she was in, after which was where this village was suppose to begin, specified in writing that, save for letters familiar here and there already forgotten, and apparent in it's supposed, now forgotten and forgiven, grandiosity, the beginning of the perimeters of that village. An oval from the mountains, a lake somewhere in middle and in between those mountains thin white lines like one of these roads one took to enter or to exit. This sign that rushed forward as there bus rushed in disregard of the steep turn upcoming, turned urgently upon a side and disappeared behind as a grey blue dot, as another dash of an mistaken brush or paint, the bus lurching downwards it's engine now off, till I began to see somewhere in the faint cloudy distance few houses with grey concrete roofs over them. Slowly the bus rolled down, halfway through started it's engine again--another jerk to there roofs, some more luggage stumbling down--the houses more numerous, brighter in colour, there gates left open, there chicken yards, there market, all empty. 

However still the bus remained travelling in between those houses, those empty yards and markets through the mud road that ran in between them, took the left turns, took the right ones, and devoid as everything was of any life--even the passengers a little concerned, how they began to chat among themselves--it kept on lurching forward till where it was suppose to end, where there was suppose to be a bus stop with already more than enough people waiting on it, but kept finding all that while, all in between these overgrown plants, these overbearing trees, life devoid of anyone littering it. All except of course those on bus with her, wondering just like her but less quiet, less in panic, till somewhere in distance like a hoot shot from a past life, she began to hear alongside everyone else--there sudden, consume silence--the noise of a riot. The bus nonetheless ran just like it was running before, walking towards where it came from the driver oblivious, uninterested in such matters, or unable to hear it at all. The noise grew louder and so did the discomfort, how they began to shrink, how the mothers began to shield there children how those children began to cry, how fathers began to look here and there, readjust in there seats--how suddenly the lady beside her, old, quiet, began to sob silently, only a mere handkerchief against her shrunken cheek--the bus refusing to hear it's own cries as it lurched forward till, somewhere in the distance again there was the stand, before it a crowd, several thousand men and boys striving to jump so they may look ahead as well and rather than angry, rather than agitated, curious instead. 

They scattered well enough when they heard the honks of the bus, went beside it or behind but kept gazing forward--now a bus as another obstacle between them--but there still remained men and boys, now more committed, willing to remain over the roads meant of new cars and buses and now all of sudden quiet indifferent to the honks now matter how loud, how insistent, as her bus suddenly came to a halting crawl. A crawl over almost the bodies of these boys but heaven forbid if it dissuaded them, they barely even noticed and kept trying almost to crawl over each other to be the first to rob to steal to kill someone to take revenge for there father she didn't knew what, only that it was necessary as soon as possible for them to be first to rip apart the rest like the crowd melting with each other, melting into each other and there bus now somewhere in between, honking twice, thrice, marching a little forward only to be stopped again, someone behind throwing  sticks or rocks and breaking glasses until suddenly--she did not knew how, did not wanted to consider--they began to give away, look with intensity as that bus slowly began to make there way, demand with there gaze an answer to question she never wanted to knew. Someone had spread the rumour, somewhere they knew they suddenly knew who on the second last seat, facing the left most window and gazing down was, was asking with each look back this confirmation but she couldn't, could not in that heat gaze them back, much as she imagined she could not look them in there eyes. 

Her house was now merely meters away, perhaps she could have even seen it but didn't dared, waited for the slog of that speed the bus then took to take them back, wishing with each seconds in passing somewhere in the distance these masses would vanish. Perhaps it did, perhaps it didn't only that, moments later when she rose her head again--it was only the noise somewhat disappearing that gave her that courage--that her house appeared in front, the gate separating the masses oh how she hated it now waiting beside it and honking again, someone by then was supposed to have seen it and was coming to open it for them, that another buzz among this masses, the people inside and insidious, more silent, more discrete whispering came back to life, a comment she caught of her dress, how she dared not to ask for this seat but just simply took it, the man beside her giving her some more space and refusing, while she looked back, to look into her eyes. The bus stop was only some meters away now, in few seconds they will all began to disembark in few minutes she would be far away, never have to smell again the smell of piss and shit and feel the hands of old men across her back, in just few seconds the gate so far stuck came back to life, the bus passed, in few quick seconds it stopped, the driver yanking the keys walked away and everyone inside began the push and pull struggle till death to decide who would be the one to leave first, who would loose and leave last. 

It was a relief all the same though, letting them have it so they might now look at her and her merely looking across the windows, shrinking herself further just in case some gentlemen or two would need to push his briefcase across her head but it was not needed, no gentlemen tried for they all fled as quickly as it came to stop, some kind of scare she wasn't sure only seconds later where there was before no space to even creep through, there remained only the remains of human lives, empty except for a chips packet, an abandoned slipper, alongside the gate the torn remains of a Saaree--blood red, golden trinkets she could almost remember who she was--and, through the dirty front side glass, her house, the gate now open, a faint yellow light beaming inside of it. 

She disembarked best she could, her legs suddenly giving ways each two steps, carrying upon her shoulders the bag whose weight in a journey this short she had already forgotten and tentatively, looking behind and looking ahead, hearing for those distant voices to hear among them groans of her names, some expletive men call at young women, leading the way till the beginning of that door appeared in front of her and the gate that was open, appeared to have a chain in between them. She pushed nonetheless but the chain, made with metal, withstood, she tried to push a finger and pry it open, pull it apart from inside as she had seen men do in those movies, but it withstood, left marks of those metals--red against her pale skin, stinging--till she pulled her knuckles and knocked, once, then twice. The knock echoed through the hall it was that empty, painfully loud against the early morning--yet there remained the protesters--but yet absent of a response, a silence as it's answer till she knocked again, something, from kitchen something metallic falling from the floor yet no one seeming to pick it--or that was what it seemed--she trying again the hardest this time to just push through the chain putting all her body's weight through her frail hands onto the door, the chain, however, lingering still till she heard from a distance, inside those walls, a footstep. Two footsteps, coming from the left--her room--a voice asking as faintly as she could who was it. 

She could not reply with her name, could not simply say it was her either for what if they heard, what if she forgot, waited while called again this time louder who was it, who would dare to disturb this early in the morning. What could she do, she knocked again, again with further ferocity hoping that would be indication enough--for who, indeed, other than the daughter herself could dare--but could not make her figure it out unless she came, stood, froze in those lingering moments of long lost recognition, a women in a plain, old Saaree, simple bangles and a simple chain running through her neck, holding among her left hand a pen, for those records she remember, how her mother used to do it, how sometimes she would try her to do it, standing as if helpless, as if till then waiting for her to speak, to speak first and before her. But she couldn't. 

"Kavya Ji" she simple said as if by accident few seconds later, a realisation hitting herself just as much "Maa Kumbh is in pain"
