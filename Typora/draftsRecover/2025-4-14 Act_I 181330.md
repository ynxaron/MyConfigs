# Act I



Afterwords, It was said that her death lingered, like lullaby of some past lives it stayed on. It was said she might as well have been right, a life like that, was it even worth living, it was said that her father had, after all, knew what she knew, knew about it all and was after all proud. It was said on morning of this January a little girl of some seven jumped into this wide iced like river, made it solid choppy red for few harrowing hours, it was said revenge for this girl had already been done, that the family responsible had already lynched. It was said that the family was not lynched at all, that they had escaped through the last of the late night trains, that though the village chased after with they couldn't keep up. It was said she still sung late in night for anyone considerate, all they had to do was to come, and listen. It was said on a villa that faced that river, on whose banks it was built by hands later cut off, there was a diamond left still after independence, and which had late that night disappeared. 

The diamond had disappeared under this mistress. She was sleeping when it was gone, she was celebrating beforehand. The diamond had disappeared when it were jubilation, when men fought then laughed it off and girls were flirting with each other, when boys drank late till late in night and women forgot to look after them. It had disappeared when the family of Kumbh decided upon a little celebration to bid off Holi, a night to let everything spill so tomorrow morning could bring new beginnings. It was stolen because, after the death of the Patriarch, his mistress inherited everything, began to spread rumours about it. The diamond that had belonged for so long in the line of that family, that had not seen any hands not of there kin, had been desecrated in front of that crowd, of the villagers and there rumours. That which had not seen light for centuries, was paraded in open view. The diamond was stolen because precisely that was the justice, and precisely this--her rumoured suicide, her blood just behind this curtained screen--was the retribution. In the rain of the next morning, when everything in colour was washed away, the town was gathering to gawk and coo like crows in between the roads that lead in and out all crowded with men and women, the gates that was suppose to guard the mansion left open, the guards-- afraid for there life--already fleeing. So, what could have been a better sight for her that this, when she was visiting after so long her only family. 

The bus lurched forward best that it could across the unpaved road, through the lush overgrown gardens--there hands of there trees like lecherous old men groping across her windows--into what the rusted metal plank, too large for it's good and with intricate colouring, all faded, left at the turn of that road, before which was the city she was in, after which was where this village was suppose to begin, specified in writing that, save for letters familiar here and there already forgotten, and apparent in it's supposed, now forgotten and forgiven, grandiosity, the beginning of the perimeters of that village. An oval from the mountains, a lake somewhere in middle and in between those mountains thin white lines like one of these roads one took to enter or to exit. This sign that rushed forward as there bus rushed in disregard of the steep turn upcoming, turned urgently upon a side and disappeared behind as a grey blue dot, as another dash of an mistaken brush or paint, the bus lurching downwards it's engine now off, till I began to see somewhere in the faint cloudy distance few houses with grey concrete roofs over them. Slowly the bus rolled down, halfway through started it's engine again--another jerk to there roofs, some more luggage stumbling down--the houses more numerous, brighter in colour, there gates left open, there chicken yards, there market, all empty. 

However still the bus remained travelling in between those houses, those empty yards and markets through the mud road that ran in between them, took the left turns, took the right ones, and devoid as everything was of any life--even the passengers a little concerned, how they began to chat among themselves--it kept on lurching forward till where it was suppose to end, where there was suppose to be a bus stop with already more than enough people waiting on it, but kept finding all that while, all in between these overgrown plants, these overbearing trees, life devoid of anyone littering it. All except of course those on bus with her, wondering just like her but less quiet, less in panic, till somewhere in distance like a hoot shot from a past life, she began to hear alongside everyone else--there sudden, consume silence--the noise of a riot. The bus nonetheless ran just like it was running before, walking towards where it came from the driver oblivious, uninterested in such matters, or unable to hear it at all. The noise grew louder and so did the discomfort, how they began to shrink, how the mothers began to shield there children how those children began to cry, how fathers began to look here and there, readjust in there seats--how suddenly the lady beside her, old, quiet, began to sob silently, only a mere handkerchief against her shrunken cheek--the bus refusing to hear it's own cries as it lurched forward till, somewhere in the distance again there was the stand, before it a crowd, several thousand men and boys striving to jump so they may look ahead as well and rather than angry, rather than agitated, curious instead. 

They scattered well enough when they heard the honks of the bus, went beside it or behind but kept gazing forward--now a bus as another obstacle between them--but there still remained men and boys, now more committed, willing to remain over the roads meant of new cars and buses and now all of sudden quiet indifferent to the honks now matter how loud, how insistent, as her bus suddenly came to a halting crawl. A crawl over almost the bodies of these boys but heaven forbid if it dissuaded them, they barely even noticed and kept trying almost to crawl over each other to be the first to rob to steal to kill someone to take revenge for there father she didn't knew what, only that it was necessary as soon as possible for them to be first to rip apart the rest like the crowd melting with each other, melting into each other and there bus now somewhere in between, honking twice, thrice, marching a little forward only to be stopped again, someone behind throwing  sticks or rocks and breaking glasses until suddenly--she did not knew how, did not wanted to consider--they began to give away, look with intensity as that bus slowly began to make there way, demand with there gaze an answer to question she never wanted to knew. Someone had spread the rumour, somewhere they knew they suddenly knew who on the second last seat, facing the left most window and gazing down was, was asking with each look back this confirmation but she couldn't, could not in that heat gaze them back, much as she imagined she could not look them in there eyes. 

Her house was now merely meters away, perhaps she could have even seen it but didn't dared, waited for the slog of that speed the bus then took to take them back, wishing with each seconds in passing somewhere in the distance these masses would vanish. Perhaps it did, perhaps it didn't only that, moments later when she rose her head again--it was only the noise somewhat disappearing that gave her that courage--that her house appeared in front, the gate separating the masses oh how she hated it now waiting beside it and honking again, someone by then was supposed to have seen it and was coming to open it for them, that another buzz among this masses, the people inside and insidious, more silent, more discrete whispering came back to life, a comment she caught of her dress, how she dared not to ask for this seat but just simply took it, the man beside her giving her some more space and refusing, while she looked back, to look into her eyes. The bus stop was only some meters away now, in few seconds they will all began to disembark in few minutes she would be far away, never have to smell again the smell of piss and shit and feel the hands of old men across her back, in just few seconds the gate so far stuck came back to life, the bus passed, in few quick seconds it stopped, the driver yanking the keys walked away and everyone inside began the push and pull struggle till death to decide who would be the one to leave first, who would loose and leave last. 

It was a relief all the same though, letting them have it so they might now look at her and her merely looking across the windows, shrinking herself further just in case some gentlemen or two would need to push his briefcase across her head but it was not needed, no gentlemen tried for they all fled as quickly as it came to stop, some kind of scare she wasn't sure only seconds later where there was before no space to even creep through, there remained only the remains of human lives, empty except for a chips packet, an abandoned slipper, alongside the gate the torn remains of a Saaree--blood red, golden trinkets she could almost remember who she was--and, through the dirty front side glass, her house, the gate now open, a faint yellow light beaming inside of it. 

She disembarked best she could, her legs suddenly giving ways each two steps, carrying upon her shoulders the bag whose weight in a journey this short she had already forgotten and tentatively, looking behind and looking ahead, hearing for those distant voices to hear among them groans of her names, some expletive men call at young women, leading the way till the beginning of that door appeared in front of her and the gate that was open, appeared to have a chain in between them. She pushed nonetheless but the chain, made with metal, withstood, she tried to push a finger and pry it open, pull it apart from inside as she had seen men do in those movies, but it withstood, left marks of those metals--red against her pale skin, stinging--till she pulled her knuckles and knocked, once, then twice. The knock echoed through the hall it was that empty, painfully loud against the early morning--yet there remained the protesters--but yet absent of a response, a silence as it's answer till she knocked again, something, from kitchen something metallic falling from the floor yet no one seeming to pick it--or that was what it seemed--she trying again the hardest this time to just push through the chain putting all her body's weight through her frail hands onto the door, the chain, however, lingering still till she heard from a distance, inside those walls, a footstep. Two footsteps, coming from the left--her room--a voice asking as faintly as she could who was it. 

She could not reply with her name, could not simply say it was her either for what if they heard, what if she forgot, waited while called again this time louder who was it, who would dare to disturb this early in the morning. What could she do, she knocked again, again with further ferocity hoping that would be indication enough--for who, indeed, other than the daughter herself could dare--but could not make her figure it out unless she came, stood, froze in those lingering moments of long lost recognition, a women in a plain, old Saaree, simple bangles and a simple chain running through her neck, holding among her left hand a pen, for those records she remember, how her mother used to do it, how sometimes she would try her to do it, standing as if helpless, as if till then waiting for her to speak, to speak first and before her. But she couldn't. 

"Didi" she simple said as if by accident few seconds later, a realisation hitting herself just as much "when did you came"

"I just came right now, was knocking but no one was opening"

"you were suppose to come this evening"

"the bus started early, where is Maa"

"Maa Kumbh, is in a lot of pain, as you can see all of this" her simple gaze across the landscape, still pretty with the noise "she has been made not good at all"

"what happened"

"come inside first" she said as she came forward twirling a hand across her waist to where the knot of keys held, where her mother used to have it, but failing to find any taking few steps back, looking across then entering this room, that room--all of that which was suppose to be so clear in her mind, all these rooms she remembered once like back of her hand--coming across again with a different key, jamming it in and keying the gate open, the chain falling across instantly. 

"wash your face, your hand, do you have a mask?" asked the old Maid

"a mask?" she asked

"any mask, just not an old one"

"no, I don't actually"

She fiddled one handed across one of the many wardrobes, all non distinct with each other, and came forward with a small towel like thing. She folded it once, put it across her face and knotted it from behind and it was only then--while the maid was clean, perhaps, but then if so why didn't she wore a mask with her, she would think of this later--she opened the door to practically an empty room, only a photo of her father barely visible, some light falling in from holes in curtained windows, and somewhere beneath this all a presence of a breath, of a body big and old, failing to breath as if, an almost odourless musk of decade long skin unclean, drenched in sweat, a sudden pungency of piss. She had taken few steps back, she barely noticed it but the maid was already in that room, putting across some things from the bed, throwing some across the floor, pushing some others further in, bending silently across that giant body--of her mothers--after which pulling as slightly as she could, as little as she could, one of those curtained windows.

A new colours of that wall, her room, the paint of her hands when she was a child now painted over, the bed that was not in before and that portrait, her father in a horse in some mountains, but except all that it was her room. The maid bend to whisper again in her ears, gestured with her swollen left hand--she didn't noticed it before--to sit across with her, one of those small across over the bed that she had just created, as she stepped in to also, with another gesture but not visible this time to her mother, to close the door behind as well. Silently she followed, watching the last light from behind vanish what was lit ahead of her, now only a breath of this corpse, herself and the maid in between them. And the sound, faint as it was, of the protest, the rock throwing, the chants. How her bangles even in this dim a light shone through. The maid crouched again, whispered something at which her mother moved her head, somewhere vaguely at her direction yet her eyes she knew looking at her, saying nothing. She moved closer, took one of her mother's hand, leaned in to hear just in case she would whisper in celebration of seeing her daughter a word or two, of encouragement, of caution, yet though warm as her hands were, alive as her nerves felt--she pressed harder just to hear in her heart her faint heartbeat--her eyes kept looking through her, open or close she couldn't tell but not at her, and her breaths each one breaking, each one with such force it might as well have been her last, held for so long, given always as if it was already too late. 

"Maa Kumbh, Maa" asked the Maid "Didi is here" Maa nodded her head "she has come early, you were waiting"  

Maa took one of her fingers from her and held it closer, silently rubbing it across as if counting on it all the while, after a moment, moving her eyes a little here and there as if in search of her, so distraught in search of the holder of the hand she had in between, and never bothering to look right at her. Her maid tried to gently point her head a little across her but nothing, it only made her eyes loop back and angry at this person, to which quickly she pulled it back.

"Maa Kumbh" she said, but Maa didn't, couldn't answer back 

"Kavya" how she instantly remembered her name, the maid looking back "why is Maa like this"

Kavya couldn't reply to this, and rather instantly drew her face a little further from her then choosing to remember something, rising, walking away from the body out the room, into the kitchen a little to the left. Some clashing of steel glasses, the sound muzzled by the thick walls, how Kavya came back a little afraid, each step a little measured, putting the glass gently enough just across her face, almost as if the odourless smell of water was to bring her back, her looking at that glass eyes open as if never all her life had been she so enchanted with something, yet not moving a single finger to take it. 

"Maa Kumbh" said Kavya, then pausing her breath held close looking at Maa examining with her shiftless gaze each breath that she then took, looking, she supposed, for any deviations, any premonitions of a move ill made by her part for she knew well as she could, considering, she supposed again, how only she had been left, of what little it took to cut the rope of a Maid, how little it took to forget and replace her with someone else, but feeling her again to be someone else, her eyes going two parts, continued 

"Maa Kumbh had been hit, one of these people" these people, how she threw back her hands at the door, the disgust at those sounds she could no longer hear--her own people, those who might replace her--"one of these days, just few days ago really one boy hit her, a rock this big" she merely showed her hands, those palms black enough to be thought of as stones "she had been injured, she leaves life and comes back every few hours and we have consulted every doctor, every doctor willing and able to come, but no one can tell what happened"

"when did this--" but immediately she shushed her, slapping her hands in place of her mouth 

"when did" she began again and quieter "when did this happened"

"few days ago, I told you"

 "but why, who did this"

"we, don't know, they won't tell us"

"what do you mean they won't tell us" but there was no venom this time, only an accusation whose answer judged by this simplicity, this calmness of her breath, needed to be simple as well, yet she could tell, how she looked down, how she hesitated once, twice

"we don't know, they say they don't know, they refuse to answer to anything else"

"how can they refuse, what are the police--" Kavya shushed again "the police, what are they doing"

"they police are trying--" at this moment a groan escaped Maa, that of pain somewhere alongside her hips as she kept rubbing it scandalously while arching her eyes up and down up and down and up her hand scattering everywhere as if somewhere in her awaken dreams she was falling from something. Kavya panicked and picked one of her arm's and began to draw like she was a sack her to some distance, the roughness of the unkempt floor calming her instead of aggravating further and then, her under-dress, the holes like rats had eaten within them exposed to the air, the fatness of her skin the layers upon layers, the black pock marks, this grim slash like those of a knife just over her belly. 

"Didi, Maa, needs to pay a lot of money"

"to who" she demanded again, this noise then her lifting, trying to lift her over the bed like she already a corpse, they a conspiracy "to whom" she whispered this time 

But Kavya couldn't quiet answer her back. Busy as she was or made herself be trying to lift limb by limb this limp corpse over the edge of the
