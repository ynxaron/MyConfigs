UOSIC_AL: "Upon Our Soiled Indic Roots, A Lotus"

The story is set upon a village in South India, where a girl has killed herself over the running river, her family in name of vengeance had been lynched, and the funeral of the patriarch of the Kurumatra family has just begin.

The Kurumatra family is a well loved family in the village. They are known to be generous, to give large and large amounts of money and yet remain quiet wealthy, grow there wealth year by year where specifically in the last few years there wealth had quadrupled, while the rest of the village went through a devastating famine.

The wife of head patriarch, Maa Kumbh as she preferred to be called, the mother of our recently graduated main character, has planned a magnificent feast for all the village to celebrate, and has invited her as much as a helping hand as she could be.

Everyday things begins to get stolen, however. Little things at first, here and there and off the sight so that days would pass before anyone would notice like a step in a stair it's absence. Causing severe damages to the planning of the funeral.

The story would end with a looting, a burning of the house.

It would begin with a thought that a little girl had jumped to the flowing river, and that one of the family looms the family had had disappeared, stolen.
