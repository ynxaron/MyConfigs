# Another Entrance To Our World 



It was said afterwords that her death lingered in each new day's fog. It lingered like lullaby of past lives, it stayed on like a smell of loved one over the edges of the village where each day the sound of water thundered over every nearby houses, it was said she might as well have been right, a life like that, was it even worth living, it was said that her father had, after all, knew what she knew, knew it all and was after all proud, wasn't he. It was said on morning of this January a little girl of some seven years age jumped into this wide ice like river, made it solid red for few harrowing hours, it was said justice for this girl had already been done, that her poor suffering family was already dead. Her family was already lynched, dragged out for this debauchery and made to make an example with there own hot red blood, dried but present where the door of her house began. It was said that the family was not lynched at all, that they had escaped through the last of the late night trains, that though they chased with bamboo stick they couldn't keep up with it. It was said for few months afterwords it would be the words last spoken to the little girl that would be heard by anyone who would dare to pass it, but she had heard none of it.
